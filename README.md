# CACR_HSM_LiDAR
The Cassia Crossbill is a unique species of finch only found in two small mountain ranges of southern Idaho. Given that the species was only listed in 2017, much of its habitat needs are unknown making it difficult to create management strategies. LiDAR can describe the 3D structure of the forest and describe what features the species needs.
