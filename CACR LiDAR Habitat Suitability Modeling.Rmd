# GitHub Setup

I am using GitHub as a form of version control, so I will need to connect this document to the repository on GitHub. While the version set up was already created in tandem to this document, RStudio will often require verification before you can push any committed changes to your code.

**This section is only needed for those modifying code**

```{r Git Setup, eval=FALSE, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# We will need the usethis package so that we can connect our GitHub

install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)

# Using the usethis package we can tell R which user will be pushing new versions to the associated repository

use_git_config(user.name = "BLLoftin96", user.email = "brittanieloftin@u.boisestate.edu")

# This will show you who is logged in and will give you options following options: 1) Abort update with error, and keep the existing credentials, 2) Replace these credentials, and 3) See the password/token. If this is a fresh session, I would recommend the replace option and re-enter your current password/token to ensure there is no connection error.

# Background

The Cassia Crossbill (*Loxia sinesciuris*) is Idaho's only endemic species whose limited range and diet put the species at risk for extinction (*FIND CITATIONS FROM NWCASC ADVISOR GRANT RE: IDFWS AND CACR STATUS*; Parmesan 2006, Benkman 1993). Similar to other crossbills whose crossed mandibles aid in prying open the conifer cones of a single species (or a variety of species) to then forage on the seeds inside (Newton 1972, Benkman 1978a, Benkman 1978b, Benkman 1988a, Benkman 1988b, Benkman 1989, Benkman 1990, Benkman 1992, Benkman 1993, Benkman and Lindholm 1991). Cassia Crossbills feed almost exclusively on the serotinous cones of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta latifolia*) and are unable to survive competition with other crossbills for other seeds elsewhere (Benkman et al. 2001, Benkman et al. 2012, Benkman 2016). Unlike the far more common Red Crossbill (*Loxia curvirostra*) that are nomadic and able to travel vast distances for food, the Cassia Crossbill have a highly restricted range limited to the 67km2 of Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine forest found on two small mountain ranges in Idaho: the South Hills and the Albion Mountains (Benkman et al. 2009, Behl and Benkman 2018; Figure 1). Despite lodgepole pine existing in other areas, the Cassia Crossbill was able to evolve in this region due to the lack of red squirrels (*Tamiasciurus hudsonicus*) which typically preemptively out-compete crossbills for cones (Benkman 1999, Smith and Benkman 2007).

![Figure 1: Map showing the South Hills and Albion Mountain range. The white outline marks the boundary of the Sawtooth National Forest](C:/Users/britt/OneDrive/Pictures/CassiaSites1.png)

The combination of being a permanent resident restricted to high elevation environments and dependent on a singular resource makes the Cassia Crossbill extremely sensitive to habitat alteration or loss (Benkman 1993). For example, in 2020 the Badger Fire swept through the western portion of the South Hills and destroyed approximately 20% of the available lodgepole in the region. In subsequent years, annual trends in the population declines significantly (*FIND CITATION FROM NW CASC GRANTS OR ANNUAL REPORTS & FIGURES*). Wildfires in this region -like many other areas in the western US - are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity in the future (Brice et al. 2020, Rogers et al. 2020). Wildfires can damage or destroy the mature stands of lodgepole pine which contain the serotinous cones - cones sealed in a resin - that Cassia Crossbills forage on. However, when these areas experience stand-replacing fires the resin on the serotinous cones melts and seeds inside have the potential to germinate and create a new stand. Serotinous cones in this region may also be affected by high summer temperatures which some evidence has shown to cause these cones to open prematurely and allowing other species to access a once exclusive resource (Benkman et al. 2001, Benkman et al. 2012, Santisteban et al. 2012, Benkman 2016).

## Data Inspection

Originally, I was using lidRviewer package in R to visually inspect the areas to see if they matched areas I had been to. However, given my storage, it wasn't possible to load the subset of tiles fully without overloading my computer or R's memory. To resolve this, I am doing a quick look over of the tiles in RStudio to quickly get a sense of whether they look natural and if they match up with the area they are intended to represent. After, the full tile is removed so I can inspect the next one. Then the full tiles are loaded into CloudCompare (version 2.13.2) for a better quality assessment to check the density patterns, canopy penetration, and ground realism. Once tiles are assess, we can configure the pipeline for filtering, classification, and generating forest metrics.

**Note: code chunks are not set to run to avoid issues with memory. Rather code chunks should only display code for reproducibility. Additionally, screenshots of CloudCompare areas were saved to compare densities and for reproducibility.**
Commands:

-   Rotate with left mouse button

-   Zoom with mouse wheel

-   Pan with right mouse button

-   Keyboard r or g or b to color with RGB

-   Keyboard z to color with Z

-   Keyboard i to color with Intensity

-   Keyboard c to color with Classification

-   Keyboard + or - to change the point size

-   Keyboard l to enable/disable eyes-dome lightning

Since I am using the raw point cloud, we are likely to see withheld and synthetic classified points. *Note: reasoning for withholding 'withheld' points:*

-   *they are points the data provider recommends you ignore*

-   *overlap in flight lines*

-   *edge-of-scan artifacts*

-   *points kept for QA but not analysis*

-   *points excluded from the official product*

*I am keeping the synthetic points because:*

-   *adds improved surface continuity*

-   *points are generated during processing*

-   *densified surfaces in workflows*

### Elko NW 2023

Based on the Elko flight reports they used 3 providers using 3 different LiDAR systems (see flight report for additional details) which had a max return per pulse of 7 to 8 (8 being the most common).

```

Overall, lidRviewer seems to indicate the area looks visually valid. Looks like some areas may have some error points and the laser couldn't always get the entire way to the ground so there are holes in there.

### Southern ID 2018 # 12

Southern ID 2018 #12 appears to have 4 different providers using 2 different systems of LiDAR. Notably the Galaxy PRIME system had a max of 7 - 8 returns while the VQ1560i had unlimited returns. CloudCompare view was excellent with the number of returns being similar to that noted in the flight plan (~7 or 8).

### Southern ID 2018 # 14

Flight appears to have hired 3 providers with 3 different LiDAR systems with 2 having unlimited returns and 1 having 9 max returns. There were no areas in this section that I had surveyed. Instead, I opted to use 3 locations of varying densities to see how they look.

```

In general, we do see some points that float above the tree line as well as some points below ground (though to a much lesser degree). Notably, densely packed areas may be harder to delineate based on LiDAR used and I notice some empty space below the canopy where it looks like the laser couldn't quite make it to the ground.

Based on this information, we should reclassify these tiles. We should begin by working with these tiles to create a general pipeline for classification (which we can then use the **batch** function to do to all tiles).

## Classification Pipeline (3 Tiles)

Here our goal is to create a pipeline by generating code using these 3 tiles. We should then be able to batch these to other tiles in the study area. Process steps:

1.  Noise Filter - start with this in case there are unusual noise below ground (may accidentally create weird geometry and makes ground classification more stable)

2.  Classify Ground Points

3.  Second cleanup of noise - if needed

### Filter Noise

When looking at the datasets there are some obvious levels of noise (in fact the amount of noise increased with each tile we examined). Filtering out these extraneous high and low (below the scene) points will help to reduce error and get us closer to the actual landscape. Note: this is only using distance to neighboring points/returns and no use of scan angle/intensity

First let's try the **ivf (isolated voxel function)** from lidR to filter the noise by searching the returns for ones that are far away from neighbors.Let's try using a filter where we filter points that are no more than 12 returns within a resolution of 4m. We then filter the points by removing those that are classified as noise (the LASNOISE = 18).

Overall, we we should check if the IVF being too strict by either counting how many points were removed. Commonly, \< 1-2% is fine but anything greater than 5% should be looked at visually. We will also visually check the filters to see if they were appropriate and we may play with parameters to see which produces the best result.

Additionally, we will be filtering the withheld flagged points since they are not recommended for use.

```

### Ground Classification

Working in mountainous forests, we will need to keep track of the parameters that we use. It is standard to use a cloth simulation filter which is available through the LiDAR function csf(). With the csf function, the LiDAR point cloud is inverted, and a simulation of a “rigid cloth” is draped over the inverted point cloud. The simulated cloth surface is then used to determine which points are associated with the ground.

CSF is controlled by:

-   how stiff the 'cloth' is --\> rigidity

-   how coarse the 'cloth' mesh is --\> cloth resolution

-   much much sagging is allowed --\> slope smoothing

We will also be trying the PMF (progressive morphological filter) which creates a small window and fins the low points where it then gradually increases the window size and allow higher thresholds as terrain scale increases.Then, we will compare the two. I expect that the CSF may perform better compared to the PMF due to the mountainous terrain.

PMF is controlled by:

-   window size(s) (scale of terrain features)

-   height threshold (how much deviation from the ground is allowed)

**Here we will begin with starting with the default then check the DTM and tune from there. Since we are classifying these ourselves, we should be on the lookout for DTM pits, sinks, or 'wavy' terrain**

Once points are classified, you know which points are associated with the ground, but because points are not continuous on the ground, you still need to interpolate between them to get an elevation map. For this, you can use a Delaunay triangulation which interpolates a continuous surface as a triangulation between the points classified as ground. You can implement the triangulation using the rasterize_terrain() function in the lidR package with the tin() algorithm selected.

```{r}
# Example Code
Classified_las = classify_ground(ClassFilt_las, algorithm = csf())
Classified_Full_LAS <- classify_ground(Filt_Full_las, algorithm = csf())

# I get a warning saying points were originally classified. This is because NEON data - which is used for this - comes pre-classified; however, this is not always the case. 
lidRviewer::view(Classified_las)

lidRviewer::view(Classified_Full_LAS)

# Press c to view classified points. Blue = ground
DEM = rasterize_terrain(Classified_las, res = 1, algorithm = tin())
Full_DEM <- rasterize_terrain(Classified_Full_LAS, res = 1, algorithm = )

terra::plot(Full_DEM)
terra::plot(DEM)

# We can also make a map for slope and aspect
slope = terrain(DEM, v='slope', unit = 'degrees')
Full_slope <- terrain(Full_DEM, v ='slope', unit = 'degrees')
asp = terrain(DEM, v='aspect', unit = 'degrees')
Full_asp <- terrain(Full_DEM, v='aspect', unit = 'degrees')

par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(slope)
plot(asp)
plot(Full_asp)
plot(Full_slope)
```
